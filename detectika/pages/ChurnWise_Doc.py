4. Customer can then grant select and insert access to the specific tables/views containing scoring data and final results with columns matching the following definitions:

    * scoring_data:

        * customer_id (varchar(100))
        * creditscore (number(10,0))
        * geography (varchar(1000))
        * gender (varchar(100))
        * age (number(5,0))
        * tenure (number(5,0))
